.SH NAME
config \- Back In Time configuration file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
~/.config/backintime/config
.br
/etc/backintime/config
.SH DESCRIPTION
Back In Time was developed as pure GUI program and so most functions are only usable with \fBbackintime-qt\fR. But it is possible to use Back In Time e.g. on a headless server. You have to create the configuration file (~/.config/backintime/config) manually. Look inside /usr/share/doc/backintime\-common/examples/ for examples.
.PP
The configuration file has the following format:
.br
keyword=arguments
.PP
Arguments don't need to be quoted. All characters are allowed except '='.

Run 'backintime check-config' to verify the configfile, create the snapshot folder and crontab entries.
